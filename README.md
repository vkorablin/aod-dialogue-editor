This is an unofficial dialogue editor for the CRPG [Age of Decadence](http://www.irontowerstudio.com/).

Usage and requirements
======================

1. Get [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 2 won't work.)
2. Get [PyQT 5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5).
3. Run `python editor.py`

Where are the dialogues?
========================

Go to your *Age of Decadence* installation folder, find there a file
named *scripts.aod*. It's a zip archive; the dialogue files are inside
the *data/text/dialogues/english/* folder in that archive.
